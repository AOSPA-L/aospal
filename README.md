# AOSPA-L #

## Our vision ##
AOSPA-L is the legacy of what Paranoid Android is, an aftermarket custom ROM built upon AOSP but with several enhancements from upstreams like CodeAuroraForums. This project brings the look and feel of Paranoid Android to a bigger variety of devices, we have several talented engineers working on this project and we focus on providing the best experience to you, our users.
